I watched a tutorial to make this, but I changed a lot of it to make it optimized and fit the criteria.

In the beginning you can see three lists with colors, those lists go into a dictionary to make it so that the color of the spiral can be customized.
The screen turns black first cuz it looks better that way.

Then the program asks you how many times you want it to repeat.
I was debugging for a whole night to figure out how to involve recursion, because my friest version had none. It was really simple in hindsight, I just needed to add a counter that would tick down with each recusion of the function.

I don't know how to attatch testcases inside of files, but each testcase will run with 2 recursions, each screenshot shows a different color palette while it's being made during the first repeat. 
Color palettes are as follow: RG(RE-GREEN), RB(RED-BLUE), BG(BLUE-GREEN), JG(WEIRD JADE GREEN PALATTE)

This can honestly repeat any number of times, because the program doesn't get laggy because of how slow and simple it is, it's just layering over itself, so the user can enter any value for recusion

Since I used a tutorial to start off with, all the beginning code didn't require any debugging. Only what I added needed debugging, and all I added was the color palettes and recursion. Since color palettes were really easy to make, I didn't actually need to troubleshoot anything there, and I didn't debug that much for the recursion either, I just experimented slightly to figure out how to make my counter go down.

This is the closest thing I could find to the tutorial I had. I added the erase feature onto it afterwards.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97XCTnF84g4&t=2s

Peer Review: added pictures, idk how to summarize anything, but that shows everything jayden thought.
